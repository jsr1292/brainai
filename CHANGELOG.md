# Changelog

Each release says what changed and whether updating needs anything from you. Updating is always
`git pull && docker compose up -d --build` in `~/memory`; Cairn copies its database to `data/pre-migrate/` before
any change to it. Settings › Backups and health shows the version you run.

## 1.0.0 (2026-11-06)

The first public release.

- **Memory for all your assistants:** one MCP server that Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build and
  OpenCode connect to with OAuth. Facts (decisions, statuses, roadmaps, your profile) and pages (long documents),
  with recall that understands meaning as well as words, in several languages.
- **You stay in charge:** changes to your profile and memories that read like instructions wait for your approval;
  forgetting sticks (an assistant can't quietly save a deleted fact again); secrets are refused.
- **Dashboard:** projects with their statuses, roadmaps and pages; a weekly review; tidy-up suggestions;
  discussions where several assistants answer one question in rounds; pictures and diagrams in pages.
- **Shared skills:** skills you share from one computer reach your other assistants, with versions and proposals.
- **Guided setup:** a page per app with the text to paste, and a number that shows when an app's text is out of date.
- **Backups:** nightly snapshots copied to your other drives, a nightly Markdown export into git, and a weekly
  encrypted off-site copy.
- **Work mode:** a separate copy that runs on a work laptop with nothing shared with home.
- **Your settings stay yours:** your own texts and script settings live in `overlay/`, which updates never touch.
